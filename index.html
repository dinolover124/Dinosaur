        <p>Dinosaurs are prehistoric animals that lived from <strong>252 until 65 million years ago</strong>. <em>Scientists</em> still dont understand how they were extinct. Some say that they were extinct from a <em>meteor shower</em>, some say it was some kind of <em>global warming</em>.</p>

        <h2 id="Timeline">Dinosaur Timeline Areas</h2>
        <p>I know alot of you have heard about dinosaurs, but do you really know about their Era/Timeline of existence?
        <h3>1. The Triassic Period</h3>
        <p>The Triassic Period, the first timeline area for dinosaurs. It began from <em>252 million years ago until 199 million years ago</em>. Dinosaurs that lived in that timeline are <strong>carnivores, herbivores, and omnivores such as Staurikosaurus, Postosuchus, Plateosaurus, and small omnivore Coelophysis.</strong></p>
        <h3>2. The Jurassic Period</h3>
        <p>The Jurassic Period, the middle timeline area for the dinosaurs, some call it the golden age of the dinosaurs. It began from <em>199 million years ago until 145 million years ago.</em> Dinosaurs that lived in that timeline are <strong>ferocious predators such as Allosaurus, and some herbivores such as Stegosaurus and Diplodocus</strong></p>
        <h3>3. The Cretaceous Period</h3>
        <p>The Cretaceous Period, The last timeline area for dinosaurs. It began in <em>145 million years ago</em>, but sadly it ended the <em>Mesozoic Era</em> in <strong>65 million years ago</strong>. Some dinosaurs that lived in that period are some of the most <em>recognizable</em> dinosaur of all, <strong>The Tyrannosaurus Rex, Spinosaurus, Corythosaurus, and Velociraptor</strong>.</p>

        <h2 id="Species">Dinosaur Species</h2>
        <p>You all have probably seen the different species of dinosaurs in books, or youtube, or movies, but i dont think you know that the real species arent in the names.
        <h3>1. Sauropods</h3>
        <p>Sauropods are the biggest herbivores of the dinosaurs, like <em>Apatosaurus, Brachiosaur, Camarasaurus</em>. They all have things in common, <strong>Long Necks, long tails, small head and four thick pillar like legs</strong>.</p>
        <h3>2. Theropods</h3>
        <p>Theropods are carnivores, like The <em>Tyrannosaurus Rex, Spinosaurus, Deinonychus</em>. They also have things in common like how they <strong>walk on two feet, they also have three toe'd limbs</strong>.</p>
        <h3>3. Ornithischians</h3>
        <p>Ornithischians are herbivores that dont have long necks or long tails, like <em>Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Parasaurolophus</em>. They are <strong>herbivores that can defend themselves when needed</strong>.</p>

        <h3>1. Tyrannosaurus</h3>
        <p>Tyrannosaurus is a genus of <em>coelurosaurian</em> theropod dinosaur. The species Tyrannosaurus rex <strong>(rex meaning "<em>king</em>" in Latin)</strong>, often called T. rex or colloquially T-Rex, is one of the most well-represented of the large theropods. Tyrannosaurus lived throughout what is now western North America.</p>
        <h3>2. Triceratops</h3>
        <p>Triceratops is a genus of herbivorous <em>ceratopsid</em> dinosaur that first appeared during the late Cretaceous period, about <em>68 million years ago</em> in what is now North America. It is one of the last known non-avian dinosaur generation, and became extinct in the <strong>Cretaceous extinction event <em>66 million years ago</em></strong>. The name Triceratops, which literally means "<em>three-horned face</em>".</p>
        <h3>3. Stegosaurus</h3>
        <p>Stegosaurus, is a genus of <em>herbivorous thyreophoran</em> dinosaur. Fossils of this genus date to the <strong>Late Jurassic period</strong>, where they are found in <em>Kimmeridgian</em> to early Tithonian aged strata, between <strong>155 and 150 million years ago</strong>, in the western United States and Portugal. It's name means "<em>Roofed Lizard</em>".</p>
